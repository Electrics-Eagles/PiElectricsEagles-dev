You need run cargo via sudo mode, because this software used file path of /etc/pielectricseagles/config.ini.
After exit server, need clear processor via command sudo kill -9 PID, where PID is pid-number of processor. 
To finding pid processor, entering command sudo lsof -i :7878
To avoid error when run server at next time

If you run this software without sudo then file of configuration cannot write and software will terminal with errorness.
Example of showing ternimal: 
Path of core config: /etc/pielectricseagles/config.ini
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 13, kind: PermissionDenied, message: "Permission denied" }', src/main.rs:77:51
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
