There are several not really complicated steps to follow for became a developer for that amazing project.

1. First you need specify the topic of you development. So we had :
   * Low level Rust programming (e.g code the drone and create documentation for low level basic code)
   * Low level C++ /C development for PiElectricsEagles OS (e.g adding hardware support and features to OS )
   * Shell /Bash development for  PiE,lectricsEagles OS 9e.g automatic loading script , backup script , error fetch script ....)
   * JavaFX/CSS The PiElectricsEagles Configurator development (e.g buttons /forms that will perpare everything for fly)
   * Java Idea Plugin development 
   * HTML / CSS/JS website improvement and editing.
   * Python scripts support
   * Tools for Bug testing and supporting project.

2. See your code on that topic and try understand main ideas . If something not clear contact us on discord server or make discussion here.
2.1 Install all tools by our instructions on wiki`s and try to build the code. Then move next stage ..
3. Try write code and if you like it  make pull request. Obligatory email and ask me to pull request code. If we like it we will reply and give you explanation what next. It we don`t like it we will reply as well and send you improvement to make :)
